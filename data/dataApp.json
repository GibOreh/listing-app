  "description": "Don't Starve: Shipwrecked will be one of the weirdest survival games you'll ever play. Don't be surprised when you're surprised by hand-drawn graphics that look like they were made by amateurs and you're wondering whether you should play or not. Then the careless, free and cheerful style in that picture will lead you to many interesting and harmful factors. A game with such good features is worth experiencing.Unfortunate pirate encounters shipwreck and desert island survival adventure!\n\nBackground\nIt is known that Don't Starve: Shipwrecked is an extension of the Don't Starve game published by Klei Entertainment. This episode concerns naive pirate Wilson who is unfortunate enough to be shipwrecked and stranded on a tropical archipelago. So no matter how skilled a pirate he was in the past, Wilson now has to carefully find a way to survive so he can make it through the day in this place with no sign of humans.\n\nThe tropical world is very different\nThe story is about a tropical island, but what greets your eyes from the first screen frame will be a dark and gloomy space that is not fun at all. It's not wrong to call this an extremely strange survival game.",
